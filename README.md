# The Unfillable Form ðŸŽ¯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Falcon

### Team Members
- Team Lead:Mathews Vinoy - Mar Baselios Christian college of engineering and technology,Peermade
- Member 2: Alan Thomas - Mar Baselios Christian college of engineering and technology,Peermade

### Project Description
An intentionally frustrating web form that challenges users with unconventional input methods. Features include a hover-based keyboard for name entry, mathematical calculations for phone numbers, and binary bit manipulation for entering dates.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Forms are just too easy to fill out these days! People are getting spoiled with their convenient dropdowns and regular keyboards. We need to bring back the challenge and excitement to form-filling!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created the most unnecessarily complicated form interface that:
- Makes you hover-dance through an on-screen keyboard for your name
- Turns phone number entry into a math quiz
- Transforms date selection into a 24-bit binary adventure

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Mathematical Operators
- Binary Bit Operations
- User's Patience

### Implementation

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MathewsVinoy/The-Unfillable-Form.git

# No dependencies needed! We keep our torture simple.
```

#### Run
```bash
# Open index.html in your browser
# Prepare for frustration
```

*The notorious hover keyboard - Move fast or start over!*

![Mathematical Phone Entry](Add screenshot of phone number math interface here)
*Phone number entry through mathematical equations - Because typing numbers is too mainstream*

![Binary Date Picker](Add screenshot of binary date picker here)
*24-bit date picker: 12 bits for year, 4 for month, 8 for day - Dating made complicated*

*Watch users attempt to fill out the unfillable - hilarity ensues*

## Technical Implementation Details

### Binary Date Format
- Year (12 bits): Allows values from 0-4095
- Month (4 bits): Allows values from 1-12
- Day (8 bits): Allows values from 1-31
- Total: 24-bit date representation

### Input Methods
1. Hover Keyboard
   - Letters appear only on hover
   - Timer-based selection
   - Move quick or lose progress!

2. Mathematical Phone Entry
   - Numbers must be derived through calculations
   - Multiple operations required
   - Real mathematicians only!
