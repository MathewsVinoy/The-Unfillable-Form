### Project Description
The Unfillable Form is an interactive form that is designed to be extremely challenging to fill out. It includes an on-screen keyboard for name input, a mathematical calculation for phone number input, and a 24-bit value for date of birth input.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are too efficient at filling out forms.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Create a form that is so challenging, it will make users question their sanity!
